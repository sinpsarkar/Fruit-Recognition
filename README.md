**Fruit-Recognition**

In this project, we shall train some pre-defined model architectures like **ResNet50**, **EfficientNetB3** and **InceptionV3** on a large number of Training dataset consisting of images of various fruits.
We shall then use the best model (model with the best accuracy) to predict random images of fruits.

The Observations of the training are as below:

**ResNet50V2:**

**EfficientNetB3**

**NOTE : ** As we are using the free GPUs available with Google Colab, Kaggle, Paperspace Gradient, which have a limitation on usage, we are not able to train these architectures for the best possible outcomes.
