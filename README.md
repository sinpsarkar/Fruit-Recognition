**Fruit-Recognition**

In this project, we shall train some pre-defined models like **ResNet50**, **EfficientNetB3** and **InceptionV3** on a large number of Training dataset consisting of images of various fruits.
We shall then use the best model (model with the best accuracy) to predict random images of fruits.
